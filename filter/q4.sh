sort -r /etc/passwd
# You can use the "sort" command to sort the "/etc/passwd" file in descending order based on the usernames
# In this command, the "-r" option is used to sort the file in reverse order, which means the usernames will be sorted in descending order. When you execute this command, the sorted output will be displayed on the terminal
